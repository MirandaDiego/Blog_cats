                    Cats are fascinating animals and surrounded by mysteries. Independent in temperament and
                    mysterious, these felines are known for their agility, elegance and a
                    lots of
                    sometimes unpredictable. However, recently, a theory has gained space on the internet and among
                    Conspiracy theorists: Are cats astronauts? <br>
                    The theory suggests that cats are not terrestrial animals, but extraterrestrial beings
                    sent
                    to carry out a specific mission on our planet. There are historical reports that point to
                    O
                    fact that cats were considered sacred beings in different cultures and even
                    associated with divine figures. This could indicate that cats have a much more
                    mystique than previously thought. <br> <br>

                    Furthermore, there are theorists who believe that felines have telepathic abilities and are
                    capable of communicating with other alien species. This belief is based on reports of
                    people who claim to have seen cats reacting to stimuli that are not perceptible to their
                    beings
                    humans, or even behaving unusually during astronomical events, such as
                    one
                    Northern Lights. These and other signs were interpreted as signs that cats
                    would be
                    interplanetary beings.
